# Business Understanding

## Sub-Phases

### Business Objectives

- **Project Goal:** Develop a robust macroeconomic forecasting tool that provides accurate predictions of key economic indicators.

- **Specific Objectives:**
    - Create a predictive model for GDP growth, inflation, unemployment rates and/or important indicators of different countries.
    - Build an interactive web application for users to explore forecasts.
    - Demonstrate advanced time-series forecasting techniques.
    - Use AI to forecast key economic indicators.

### Assess the Situation

- **Current Context:** 
    - Economic indicators are critical for policy-making, investment decisions, and strategic planning.
    - Lack of a centralize hub that mixes different data sources from mayor organizations (i.e World Bank, IMF, OECD, etc.)
    - Many economic organizations (World Bank, IMF, OECD) provide their own forecasts in dedicated publications, making it difficult to compare and contrast predictions.

- **Project Resources:**
    - Data sources: FRED, OECD, World Bank, IMF databases
    - Potential tools: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and Shiny.
    - Machine learning models: ARIMA, VAR, LSTM.

### Determine Data Mining Goals
- Specify the desired accuracy and usability of the forecasts.
- An interactive platform that consolidates these forecasts with my own would provide valuable insights into consensus and divergence among major institutions.
- Reduce the effort it takes to search estimates of the main international economic organizations.

### Produce Project Plan
- Outline the timeline, resources, and milestones for app development.
