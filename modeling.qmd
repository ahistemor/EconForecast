# Modeling

## Sub-Phases

### Select Modeling Techniques
- Evaluate forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, VAR, machine learning).
- Choose techniques based on data characteristics and goals.

### Generate Test Design
- Define how models will be validated (e.g., train-test split, cross-validation).
- Specify performance metrics for evaluation.

### Build Models
- Train models using the prepared macroeconomic dataset.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

### Assess Models
- Evaluate models using validation data.
- Compare performance metrics to select the best model(s).

## Objectives
- Select appropriate forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, VAR, machine learning models).
- Train and validate models using macroeconomic data.

## Deliverables
- Performance metrics for forecasting models.
- Selected model(s) for deployment.
